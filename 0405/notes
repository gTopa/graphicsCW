Hidden Surface Removal

Backface Culling -> ignore backward facing polygons

V -> view vector, vector from surface of polygon to viewer
N -> surface normal, vector perpendicular to plane of polygon

1. Calculate surface normal
2. Find theta bt. surface normal and view vector
3. if -90<theta<90, draw the polygon

1: 3 points, entered counter clockwise
   find 2 vectors (A,B) that share an endpoint, go out from the endpoint
   A=p1-p0, <x1-x0,y1-y0,z1-z0>
   B=p2-p0

   N=AxB, <ay*bz-az*by, az*bx-ax*bz, ax*by-ay*bx>

2: law of cosines
   N.V=|N|*|V|*cos(theta)
   -90<theta<90 -> cos(theta)>0
   |N|*|V| > 0
   so we care about sign of N.V
   N.V = nx*vx+ny*vy+nz*vz -> nz
   V = <0,0,1>
