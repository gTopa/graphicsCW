Transformations:

Only have to modify pixels we use in drawline

Edge list -> structure that store points that make up lines, every two points make a line -> e.g. [p1,p2,p3,p4,p5...]

Triangle ABC: [A,B,B,C,C,A]

Apply transformation by modifying each point on edge list

Storing and representing edge lists:
   Each point will have x, y, z components
   Each component should be a floating point #
   [x0,x1,x2,x3...xn
    y0,y1,y2,y3...yn
    z0,z1,z2,z3...zn
    1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,...1.0]

Matrix Math:

  -Matrix Multiplication
  -Multiplicative Identity

Scalar Mult:
s* [a,b  = [sa,sb
    c,d]    sc,sd]

Matrix Mult (restriction: (M)(N) -> num of columns in M must equal num of rows in N)
(AxB)(BxC)=(AxC)

(4x4)(4xN)=(4xN)
