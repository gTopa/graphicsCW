Transformations:

Only have to modify pixels we use in drawline

Edge list -> structure that store points that make up lines, every two points make a line -> e.g. [p1,p2,p3,p4,p5...]

Triangle ABC: [A,B,B,C,C,A]

Apply transformation by modifying each point on edge list

Storing and representing edge lists:
   Each point will have x, y, z components
   Each component should be a floating point #
