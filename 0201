Aim: Bits o' pixels

How to rep color w/ following amount of space (color depth):
1 bit: white/black, on/off
2 bits: first bit for color, second for intensity
3 bits:	rgb, on or off
4 bits: rgb, intensity
6 bits: rgb, each color has its own intensity

Image files: Uncompressed (piece of data for each pixle), Compressed, Lossless (direct rep of original src), Lossy (not direct rep of original src)
      -gif(c,l)
      -png(c,l) -> run length encoding (lossless compression algo) -> doesnt work well if lots of dif colors
      -jpg(c,ly)
      -bmp(u,l)
      -tiff(u,l)

rle: gggrpppp -> 3g1r4p

vector(sug, pdf) drawing instructions, scalable -> line 01 10 50, fcricle 20 20 5, char q 10 100 25

Net PBM (u,l)
-ppm
-all whitespace is the same
-format:
   Header -> P3
       	     XRES, YRES, MAX COLOR
   Pixel Data -> R G B R G B...
